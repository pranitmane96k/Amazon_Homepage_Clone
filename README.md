# Amazon_Homepage_Clone

## Overview

This project is a clone of the Amazon home page, built using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate my skills in front-end development by replicating the design and layout of a well-known e-commerce website.

## Features

- *Responsive Design:* The layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- *Navigation Bar:* A fully functional navigation bar similar to the one on Amazon.
- *Product Listings:* Includes a section to showcase products with images, titles, and prices.
- *Footer Section:* Contains links and information, resembling the Amazon footer.
- *Search Functionality:* A basic search bar that mimics Amazon's search feature (Note: Search functionality is non-functional in this static version).

## Technologies Used

- *HTML5:* Markup language used for structuring the content.
- *CSS3:* Stylesheet language used for designing and laying out the page.
